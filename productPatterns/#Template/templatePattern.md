## Introduction

This sample product pattern shows what is needed when creating a new pattern. This file can be copied and each area should be updated for new patterns being created.

### Request mechanism

The request mechanism describes how customers will make a request. This could be via an ITIL solution, or it could be within the product itself, or through some other management portal like API Management.
